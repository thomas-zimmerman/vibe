# State

Probably not really user friendly at the moment but useable. Still under active development.

# Usage

1. Install `pavucontrol` (or any other tool to see which programs are currently recording and change the source).
2. You will need some development library support. On the Pop!OS alpha of 24.04, install the following packages:
```
sudo apt install librust-wayland-client-dev librust-alsa-sys-dev libxkbcommon-dev
```
3. Compile and run the binary with `cargo run --release`
5. Your microphone is very likely be catched as the audio source.
   To fix that open up `pavucontrol` and set the audio source (see: https://github.com/TornaxO7/shady?tab=readme-ov-file#shady-audio-doesnt-listen-to-my-systems-audio)

If you'd like to tweak around:
Take a look at the output. It will give you the path where you can to tweak some things.
To see the changes, kill the process and start it again.
